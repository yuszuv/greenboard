This is a side project. It is a board where you can post your offers/requests. You also can subscribe to updates (e.g. new entries).

This code is written using the incredible awesome gems of

* [hanami-rb](https://www.hanamirb.org)
* [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org) (actually using f*cking awesome algebraic effects /w dry-effects ü¶Ñ)
* [rom-rb](https://www.rom-rb.org)
* [vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org)

I used this task to get used to this gems ... and I can truely recommend the developing experience :)

The application was set up using the [Hanami 2 application template](https://github.com/hanami/hanami-2-application-template)

## TODO

... the remainder of this README is from the application template's one:

## Docker development

To bootstrap and setup the app and its assets server, just run:

```
script/setup docker
```

To start the app:

```
docker-compose up app
```

## Local development

### Requirements

The scripts below require [Homebrew][brew] and [asdf][asdf] installed, and
[asdf added to your shell][asdf-shell].

If you prefer different tools, remove `Brewfile` and `.tool-versions`, and adapt
the `script/` files (mentioned below) to use your preferred tools.

[brew]: https://brew.sh
[asdf]: https://asdf-vm.com
[asdf-shell]: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm?id=add-to-your-shell

### Local setup

After cloning, run:

```
./script/bootstrap
```

#### Running supporting services

To start the supporting services, run:

```
./script/support
```

These must be running before completing the following steps.

#### Setup

After the supporting services have started, run:

```
./script/setup
```

### After pulling changes

After pulling changes from the remote, run:

```
./script/update
```

#### Running the app

To run the app:

```
./script/server
```

This launches the application processes using [overmind][overmind], which places
each into a [tmux][tmux] session. You can connect to a specific process to
interact with it (which is useful when using an interactive debugger inside the
`web` process):

```
overmind c web
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To detatch from the tmux session, use the
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>,<kbd>d</kbd> shortcut.
